## The RforMassSpectrometry initiative

For general enquiries about the initiative, you can [open an
issue](https://github.com/RforMassSpectrometry/RforMassSpectrometry.org/issues)
or use the contact email below.

We plan to add additional discussion channels in the near future.

## Software and usage

For questions about specific software or their usage, please refer to
the software's github issue page, or use the [Bioconductor support
site](http://support.bioconductor.org/). 

## Website

For questions or comments about the website, please refer to the
[Github repo](http://github.com/RforMassSpectrometry/RforMassSpectrometry.org).

- If you spot any small problems with the website, please feel
  empowered to fix them directly with a pull request.

- If you see any larger problems, an issue is probably better: that
  way we can discuss the problem before you commit any time to it.

For any other questions, please use the email address below.

## Latest news

We will be tweeting news about the RforMassSpectrometry initiative on
twitter using the
[#RforMassSpec](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rformassspec) hastag.

You can also be notified when project specific issues are created or
discussed by watching a repositories issues. This is probably the best
way to keep track of specific software and their development.
