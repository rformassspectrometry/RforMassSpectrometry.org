## Documentation

Ample documentation is provided within each individual package. All package
vignettes are also available  Each package provides specific documentation.

In addition, a comprehensive book as well as tutorials and workshops are
available showing how the functionality from different packages can be combined
into specific analysis workflows.


### R for Mass Spectrometry Book

The [R for Mass Spectrometry book](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/book/)
provides a good introduction into the ecosystem of the R for Mass Spectrometry
packages. It is continuously expanded to include additional topics and example
use cases.


### Tutorials/workshops

Specific use cases and extended analysis workflows are also presented as
workshops (tutorials). They usually come with a dedicated
[docker](https://www.docker.com) image that provides the workshop's source code
along with all data and an R installation which includes all required packages
ensuring full reproducibility.

- [Metabonaut](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/Metabonaut/): collection
  of tutorials and workflows for MS-based metabolomics data analysis including
  a complete end-to-end metabolomics data analysis workflow.
- [SpectraTutorials](https://jorainer.github.io/SpectraTutorials): provides 3
  tutorials explaining internals, properties and extensions of the
  [Spectra](https://github.com/RforMassSpectrometry/Spectra) package and the
  provided infrastructure to handle and process mass spectrometry data.
- [xcms4gnps2](https://jorainer.github.io/xcms4gnps2/): example workflow for an
  *xcms*-based preprocessing of an LC-MS/MS data set and export of the results
  in a format suitable for *feature based molecular networking* (FBMS) with
  GNPS.
- [xcmsTutorials](https://jorainer.github.io/xcmsTutorials): explains general
  mass spectrometry data handling with
  [Spectra](https://github.com/RforMassSpectrometry/Spectra) and analysis of
  LC-MS data with the [xcms](https://github.com/sneumann/xcms) package.
- [MetaboAnnotationTutorials](https://jorainer.github.io/MetaboAnnotationTutorials):
  use cases and examples for annotation of untargeted metabolomics data using
  the
  [MetaboAnnotation](https://github.com/RforMassSpectrometry/MetaboAnnotation)
  package.
